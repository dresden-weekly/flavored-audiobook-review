# flavored-audiobook-review
Single page audiobook and audiobook-reader review/rating website app based on [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) or maybe [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) or [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) to gather some experience with (one or more of) these frameworks.

Additionally it would be interesting to think about whether/how *flavored* ratings could be realized with some simple logic in a database-backend. *Flavored* in the sense of "rated by appreciated people" or "rated by people with similar preferences".
